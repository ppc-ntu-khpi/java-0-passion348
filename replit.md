# Java OOP Lab Project

## Overview
This is a Java educational lab assignment for an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course. It contains simple Java exercises to practice creating, compiling, and running Java programs.

## Project Structure
- `src/` - Contains Java source files
  - `Shirt.java` - A class representing a shirt with properties like ID, description, color, price
  - `ShirtTest.java` - Test class to run Shirt demonstration
  - `Quotation.java` - A class that stores and displays a quote
  - `QuotationTest.java` - Test class to run Quotation demonstration
- `Solution/` - Folder for storing screenshots and solution files
- `build.gradle` - Gradle build configuration with JUnit testing

## How to Run
The project uses a shell script `start.sh` that:
1. Compiles all Java files in the `src/` directory
2. Runs `ShirtTest` to display shirt information
3. Runs `QuotationTest` to display a quotation

## Recent Changes
- January 25, 2026: Initial setup for Replit environment
  - Installed Java 21
  - Created Shirt.java and Quotation.java as per lab instructions
  - Configured workflow to run the programs

## User Preferences
- Language: Ukrainian (based on README)
- IDE: Replit environment

## Technical Notes
- Uses Java 21
- Build system: Gradle (for testing)
- Direct javac compilation for running examples
